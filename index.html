            <h3>Smart Indoor Locator</h3>
            <p>At University of Rwanda, College of Science and Technology the Agaciro Building serves as a significant hub for offering offices, computer labs, Engineering labs and IoT lab services. As with many such institutions, visitors, students often face challenges in navigating the space and accessing specific information about offices or classrooms and laboratories.  This building is one that is used for computer-based examinations for public institutions. To enhance the students and visitors experience, this research project focuses on developing an innovative indoor localization app using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The proposed system aims to revolutionize how visitors and students engage with the Agaciro Building by providing real-time location-based content delivery. Through the integration of IoT technologies, visitors will receive personalized information and recommendations based on their location within the building, creating a dynamic and interactive experience. Additionally, the system will enable the collection of valuable data on visitor behavior and preferences, empowering the building's management to make data-driven decisions to improve overall visitor satisfaction. This abstract presents the foundation and objectives of the project, highlighting the potential impact of the developed solution on enhancing navigation and time management at the Agaciro Building..</p>
